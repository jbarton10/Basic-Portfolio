            About me:
        </h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Jamie Barton. I am 22 years old and have always had a passion for different technologies!  
            Ever sense I was young I have loved playing video games and messing around on computers. This lead me down a path
            to begin coding and wanting to understand how computers work.

            I am born and raised in Tucson Arizona, and I went to Cattilina Foothills High School.  I went to NAU for two years out of high
            school but ended up moving back because I missed Tucson.
            I enjoy hanging out with my friends, playing piano, and playing chess! I also like to go outside when it's not too hot and
            slackline! I have 3 cats and a dog, that I love very much.
